Triple Triad (Final Fantasy VIII) re-skin pc &amp; android multiplayer

[update 2022]

This is a personal project i did a long time ago, unfortunately i put a lot of logic on the
database (triggers, cascade deletions which were part of the logic loop, etc) which i didn´t save,
and as i didn´t save any screenshots, there is no way to execute the game, or even see it.

However, all the code is saved.

The server was running on a linux server using mono (https://www.mono-project.com/).
Obviously the server has not been running for a long time.

The client was build with unity and was tested for windows and android.
I haven't tried to import it to current unity, may or not have compatibility issues
